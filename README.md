# 2D-Array
A program to subtract two matrices (two dimensional arrays). Input order of matrix will be given by user. The matrices must be of the same size to be added. Get input of all the values of the matrices from user. Subtract the two matrices and store the values in a third matrix. Finally display all the matrices.
## How it Works
### Step 1
First of all the program will get input of number of rows and columns from the user.

### Step 3
Using the two nested for loop,we will input our values in the 2D arrays

### Step 4
Using another nested loop, we will substract both arrays and save it in another 2d array.

### Step 5
Finally at the end, the loop will display the array.
